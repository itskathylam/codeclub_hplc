For this Code Club session, I will use data from my first trial HPLC experiment (!) to touch on/review/introduce:

- My system for experiment organization
- R notebooks/css snippet for width control
- Reading/wrangling exported csv data from Agilent software, including
- dplyr functions
- Piping 
- Regex

The .Rmd file and [.html notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/itskathylam/codeclub_hplc/blob/main/2020-09-09_HPLC_SN38G.html) (click to view the html notebook properly rendered in broswer) are both included here.
